# WIP

- add ctrl-y to redo

# Planned

- remove search params from goatcounter
- add site info panel (visits, last course update etc...)

- make sure user is aware if he is selecting multiple (unrequired) sessions (such as too many lectures)

- rewrite tests, make them deterministic using mock db
- make simple admin panel to show and delete contact messages

- add users comments on course page (ratings, comments)
- add instructor pages

- search instructors, and other fields
- course searching filters
- export timetable

- show empty time between sessions
- change the "my" list to have all selected courses, then from this the usre may select whatever session he wants

- show empty rooms to study in (suggest user add to timetable in empty sessions?)

# Considering

- animation when opening side panel
- automatically try to register to courses using user credentials
- full fuzzy search

# Archive (might come back)

- improve analytics (add an Analytics component? use:action?)
