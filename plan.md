# WIP

# Planned

- rewrite tests, make them deterministic using mock db
- add site info panel (visits, last course update etc...)

- add beta.braude.top domain to test site on the web (maybe allow users to check beta features?)
- make sure user is aware if he is selecting multiple (unrequired) sessions (such as too many lectures)

- save schedule for every semester on its own

- add ctrl-y to redo
- add users comments on course page (ratings, comments)
- add instructor pages

- fuzzy search

- course searching filters
- export timetable

- show time between sessions
- show walk time between buildings
- show a map, tell the user how long he has to walk between classes
- show empty rooms to study in (suggest user add to timetable windows?)

# Considering
