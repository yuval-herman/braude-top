# WIP

# Planned

### db stuff

- add course avg score

### ui stuff

- add site info panel (visits, last course update etc...)
- course searching filters
  - add filters to show only courses meant for e.g. תוכנה, חשמל...
  - filters for "my" list and "all" list
- add custom events to timetable
- suggest to add empty sessions to timetable
- profile slowdowns and memory spikes
- fix table export
- people qa

# Considering

- in course info page, show all years info, show changes between years
- instead of saving the whole course for the timetable, save the id and year as well as selected instances id and fetch needed data from the server (this will keep the data up to date)
- convert selected courses list to store

# Archive (might come back)

- make sure user is aware if he is selecting multiple (unrequired) sessions (such as too many lectures)
- improve mobile friendliness
- full fuzzy search
- automatically try to register to courses using user credentials
- animation when opening side panel
- lunch and 12:20 are the same thing, merge em'
- add instructor pages
- improve analytics (add an Analytics component? use:action?)
